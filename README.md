# Financial API

### FastAPI backend for a full stack Financial Analysis project with custom endpoints based on Richardson's maturity level three APIs.

Currently the financial data is pulled from an external API service, but the project will be enhanced with a relational database, which will be deployed and implemented in the next stages as this project is actively developed and the iterations are frequent.
